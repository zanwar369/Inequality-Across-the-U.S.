# Inequality-Across-the-U.S.
Studying inequality across the use using Gini coefficient and regression analysis. 

In this project I take data from the American Community Survey, Public Use Microdata Sample, create Gini coefficients for each state and
the U.S., as well as calculate several proportions for each. I then visualize this with a choropleth map, and do a fixed effects
regression on the data.
